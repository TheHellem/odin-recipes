# odin-recipes
Building a basic recipe website as part of the Odin Project.

Will demonstrate the basic HTML knowledge I have aquired thus far, aswell as practising writing 
well crafted commit messages.

In addition to this I have also implemented some basic CSS from additional coursework.

All recipes are from [this website](https://www.allrecipes.com/).
